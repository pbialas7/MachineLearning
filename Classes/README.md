### Titanic

This a "clasic" :smiley: The "Hello World!" of Machine Learning (see [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).). The dataset contains the data about the passengers of the infamous Titanic. You can find more details about this data set [here](http://campus.lakeforest.edu/frank/FILES/MLFfiles/Bio150/Titanic/TitanicMETA.pdf). The goal is to train a classifier that will predict survivors based on sex, passenger class and  age.  

You will explore some of the of pandas features and learn few methods to deal with missing data. 

### Enron spam classicaton


In this assignment you will train a classifier to recognise spam emails. The data was taken from this [enron spam](https://www.kaggle.com/wanderfj/enron-spam)  kaggle dataset. The dataset is described [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221650814_Spam_Filtering_with_Naive_Bayes_-_Which_Naive_Bayes). This will familiarize you with tools  for text analysis  from  the scikit-learn library. 

### Skin segmentation

In this assignemnt you will train a Guassian Discriminative Analysis classifier to classify pixels as skin or no skin based on the color. The data is taken from [Skin Segmentation Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Skin+Segmentation#) in the UCI Machine Learning repository.
