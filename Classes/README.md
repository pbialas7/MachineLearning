### Titanic

This a "clasic" :smiley: The "Hello World!" of Machine Learning (see [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).). The dataset contains the data about the passengers of the infamous Titanic. You can find more details about this data set [here](http://campus.lakeforest.edu/frank/FILES/MLFfiles/Bio150/Titanic/TitanicMETA.pdf). The goal is to train a classifier that will predict survivors based on sex, passenger class and  age.  

You will explore some of the of pandas features and learn few methods to deal with missing data. 

### Enron spam classicaton


In this assignment you will train a classifier to recognise spam emails. The data was taken from this [enron spam](https://www.kaggle.com/wanderfj/enron-spam)  kaggle dataset. The dataset is described [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221650814_Spam_Filtering_with_Naive_Bayes_-_Which_Naive_Bayes). This will familiarize you with tools  for text analysis  from  the scikit-learn library. 

### Skin segmentation

In this assignemnt you will train a Gaussian Discriminative Analysis classifier to classify pixels as skin or no skin based on the color. The data is taken from [Skin Segmentation Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Skin+Segmentation#) in the UCI Machine Learning repository. 

### Banknote authentication

The task in this assignment is to detect the counterfeit banknotes. The data set is based on banknote authentication Data Set from UCI Machine Learning repository. The first three columns denote different parameters obtained from the photographs of the banknotes and last colum provides the label. Frankly as the dataset does not have any description I don't know which labels corresponds to real and which to counterfeited banknotes. let's assume that label one (positive) denotes the clounterfeits.

You will be using the Gaussian Mixture Discriminant Analysis for this assignment.
