# Lectures

This directory contains lecture notebooks. You can run them in `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`. 

The notebooks contain both code and the description. Please go through the notebooks executing all the code cells one by one. You can and should experiment with the code!
Some code will be given short explanation but in general you should consult the documentation. I  am using only very popular libraries for data analysis, machine learning and plotting. You will benefit greatly if you master their basic features.  So please make sure you understand what is going on. 

If you find my explanations inadequate, or find errors in code or description please do not hesistate to contact me! You can do this via email or by Teams channel that I have setup for this purpose. 

Some code will more elaborate like e.g. some plotting functions and can be used "as is" without deeper understanding. 

Lectures are grouped in directories according to topic. Each directory contains a README.md file with the description of the contained notebooks.


## Content 

### Tools

This directory will contain more detailed description of some python  libraries used. At this moment I have only included  notebooks about `numpy` from my previous Deep Learning lecture. 

### Probabilistic

This directory contains notebooks on  the topic of generative methods of Machine Learning _e.g._ methods that rely on the knowledge of the data generating process.
